# Notes

## Part 1 - Survey

pi at line 4 is bound at line 3.  x at line 3 is bound at line 2, both 6 and 10 bound at 5.

## Part 2 - Scoping

g is well typed, but type is ((Int, Int), Int).  There needs to be an inductive reasoning to demonstrate this.  For instance, a+2: Int, a: Int and 2: Int.  

## Part 4 - abs, xor, repeat

Test cases not filled out.
