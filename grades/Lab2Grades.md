# Notes

## Part 2a - Judgement Form

Need a rule for A&A in AObject

## Part 3d - Scala Precedence

These operators could have same precedence, but left associativity.  Your code doesn't make this distinction.

## Part 3e - Float BNF

X should be optional, i.e., X ::= E I N | epsilon.  N and M rules cause ambiguity
