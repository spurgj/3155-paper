Code Examples

bool(0) returns: False

isinstance(obj, tuple) returns: False

True * 75 returns: 75

Status of Work
==============
So far I've just determined my subject. I've also found my team mates. 

* WIP pull request on April 3 at 6p. In the WIP, describe the topic of your paper, list your team members, expected sources, code examples, and status of your work. You should have your TA approve your plan for the paper at this time, or earlier.
